My name is Daniel Carrera and I am a student at USF's MS of Data Science program who is interested in using machine learning to improve quality of healthcare. 

The goal of this project was to predict presence of heart disease based on various labs and tests such as blood pressure, fasting blood sugar level, and max heart rate achieved. 

Getting the right treatment to the right patients is crucial, and the right treatment starts with the right diagnosis. This project found a Random Forest model that was able to identify 91.1% of patients with heart disease.
